/**
 * Create Client-Side Encryption Payment (SOAP)
 * 
 * Merchants that require more stringent security protocols or do not want the additional overhead of managing their PCI
 * compliance, may decide to implement Client-Side Encryption (CSE). This is particularly useful for Mobile payment
 * flows where only cards are being offered, as it may result in faster load times and an overall improvement to the
 * shopper flow. The Adyen Hosted Payment Page (HPP) provides the most comprehensive level of PCI compliancy and you do
 * not have any PCI obligations. Using CSE reduces your PCI scope when compared to implementing the API without
 * encryption.
 * 
 * If you would like to implement CSE, please provide the completed PCI Self Assessment Questionnaire (SAQ) A to the
 * Adyen Support Team (support@adyen.com). The form can be found here:
 * https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/security_standards/documents.php?category=saqs
 * 
 * Please note: using our API requires a web service user. Set up your Webservice user:
 * Adyen CA >> Settings >> Users >> ws@Company. >> Generate Password >> Submit
